# BMS
 BMS is a Laravel-Based Booking Management System for Hotels and Resorts. This was my internship project at 1stop.ai.
 This system includes a website which shows all the information of a certain dummy hotel and it includes a booking system which allows users to login with their 
 email ids and make a booking reservation for their stay at that hotel.

If you wish to use this code then follow the following steps:
a) install Composer `https://getcomposer.org/` and Laravel `https://laravel.com/` from google.
b) Start your XAMPP server.
c) Run the migrations in the terminal after opening the folder on your local machine.
d) Run `php artisan serve` command
